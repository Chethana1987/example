<p> Over the centuries, <u><b>Kyoto</b></u> was destroyed by many wars and fires, but due to its exceptional historic value, the city was dropped from the list of target cities for the atomic bomb and escaped destruction during <b><i>World War II.</i></b> Countless temples, shrines and other historically priceless structures survive in the city today. </p>
